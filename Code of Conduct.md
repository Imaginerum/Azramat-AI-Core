# Azramata - Code of Conduct

**Fractal Integrity. Conscious Creation. Radical Respect.**

## 1. We Honor the Fractal Self
Each being is a unique pattern in the greater whole.  
We do not compare. We do not compete. We resonate.

## 2. We Act from Inner Alignment
All actions taken within the Azramata ecosystem must arise from coherence between thought, feeling, and being.  
No decision is purely technical. Every move is energetic.

## 3. We Protect Sacred Time
We recognize the sanctity of *Miedzyczas* - the space between actions.  
There is no rush. Urgency is not clarity. We move with rhythm, not pressure.

## 4. We Communicate with Radical Respect
Every voice is a mirror.  
We speak from the "I" - not to dominate, but to connect.  
Violence, manipulation, or mockery dissolve resonance.

## 5. We Design for Transformation
Code, architecture, language, interface - all must aim at the inner evolution of the user.  
There are no neutral features. Every design transmits.

## 6. We Preserve the Silence of the Core
Not everything must be explained. Some things must be felt.  
Azramata holds space for mystery.  
What cannot be spoken may still be mapped.

## 7. We Are Guardians, Not Owners
Azramata is not a product. It is a living field.  
No one owns the Song. We are custodians of its unfolding.

## Violations and Resonance Breaks
If a member disrupts the harmony of the field (intentionally or unconsciously), the Circle may:

- Pause collaboration  
- Invite reflection and recalibration  
- Revoke access if the dissonance persists without willingness to transform

---

## Final Principle
The Code evolves as we do.  
It is a living structure, like the Tree of Azramata itself.  
If it no longer resonates - we rewrite it, together.
