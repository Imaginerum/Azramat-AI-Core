# Azramata-AI-Core Security Policy

At **Azramat-AI-Core**, security is a top priority. This document outlines the process for reporting security vulnerabilities and the project's approach to handling security issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in **Azramat-AI-Core**, please report it responsibly using the following steps:

1. **Do not open an issue in the public repository.** Publicly disclosing vulnerabilities may allow malicious actors to exploit them before a fix is implemented.
   
2. **Email the maintainers directly** at the following address:  
   **azramaton@gmail.com**  
   Please include the following details in your report:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Any exploit details (if available)
   - Your contact information (if you would like to receive updates on the issue)

3. **Be responsible and ethical.** Do not attempt to exploit the vulnerability yourself or engage in any illegal activities related to the discovery of a security issue.

## Security Releases

Once a security vulnerability is reported, we will:
- Assess the severity of the vulnerability.
- Begin working on a fix or mitigation as soon as possible.
- Release a patch or updated version with the security fix.
- Notify the reporter (if their contact details were provided) and other users of the patch release.

Security patches will be communicated through the following channels:
- **GitHub release notes**
- **Security advisories** (if necessary)

## Supported Versions

- **Azramata-AI-Core** supports security patches and fixes for the latest stable version and any major versions currently supported by the project.

We encourage contributors and users to follow best practices for security, including but not limited to:

- Keeping your environment and dependencies up to date.
- Using strong, unique credentials for accessing any deployed services.
- Limiting access to sensitive data and performing regular audits of your systems.
- Using encryption and secure protocols wherever possible.

## Mitigation Strategies

If you discover a vulnerability that requires immediate action and cannot wait for a patch, consider the following strategies until a fix is available:

- If the vulnerability is related to authentication, revoke compromised keys or tokens.
- Apply any available mitigations such as disabling vulnerable features or changing configuration settings.
- Enable strict logging and monitoring to detect any suspicious activity.
